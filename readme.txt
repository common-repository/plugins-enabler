Adds a granular control on the visibility of plugins in your network (Multisite)

== Description ==

In a network of blogs, if from the network admin settings you allow the plugins menu to be displayed on child blogs, then all 'non network' plugins will be viewable by regular admins.

If you need to have more control on the listed plugins, then Plugins Enabler will help you to manage the visibility of plugins for regular admins and on a blog by blog basis. Of caurse, Super Admin(s) will still have the visibility of all plugins. Once activated, you'll find the Plugins Enabler Manager in a submenu of the network admin plugins menu.

NB : since version 2.0, the plugin requires WordPress 3.7.
